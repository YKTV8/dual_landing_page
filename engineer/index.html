						<h2>What I Do</h2>
					</header>
					<p>At our company, we value the time and investment of our clients, and we believe that communication is the key to a successful software project. 
                    That's why we offer a simple Q&A session with our clients to hear their needs and wants for their project. This meeting can take place via phone, 
                    video chat, or in person, depending on what works best for the client.

                    During the Q&A session, we will listen to the client's ideas, goals, and requirements for their software project. We will ask questions to 
                    gain a deeper understanding of their needs and to identify any potential challenges or issues that may arise during the development process. 
                    This session is an opportunity for us to get to know our clients and to build a strong foundation for a successful project.
                    
                    We understand that investing time and resources into a software project can be a significant undertaking for our clients. That's why we 
                    want to ensure that our clients' time with us is valuable and not for nothing. By listening to their needs and wants for their project, we 
                    can provide tailored solutions that meets their unique requirements and exceed their expectations.
                    
                    At the end of the Q&A session, we will provide our clients with a clear understanding of the next steps in the development process 
                    and a transparent project plan that outlines timelines, milestones, and costs. By working closely with our clients from the outset of a project, 
                    we can ensure that we deliver a software solution that meets their needs, exceeds their expectations, and delivers real business value.</p>

						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My journey in software development began with my early studies at Green River, where I was introduced to the vast potential of JavaScript. 
                        Over time, my curiosity led me to a unique role in the bail bonds industry, where I identified opportunities for process improvement. 
                        Noticing outdated lead management methods, I played a pivotal role in creating and launching the innovative bondstracking application. 
                        This system revolutionized account management, enabling real-time updates and streamlined lead processing across 39 counties. 
                        Transitioning to the insurance sector, I pursued a career in full-lines insurance while nurturing a strong interest in software development. 
                        Despite challenges, I innovatively employed tools to enhance team performance and track progress, culminating in the development of a bonus calculation app for team members.
                        
                        As my expertise in the industry deepened, I explored the complexities of commercial lines insurance, which led to a pivotal "ah-ha" moment. 
                        I recognized the value of my role as a problem solver and sought to create tools that not only benefited my role as an agent but also streamlined renewal tracking.
                        In May 2020, I dedicated my free time to becoming a full-stack software engineer, eventually leveraging my skills to assist clients in need of digital solutions. 
                        Freelancing enabled me to build landing pages and client-facing applications, providing innovative and efficient digital solutions.
                        
                        In 2021, my wife and I established Chae & Marie Solutions, focusing on childcare and software solutions. I developed software to meet state-mandated 
                        attendance requirements, offering parents a portal for real-time updates on their child's well-being.
                        
                        Today, I am enthusiastic about joining an organization where my aptitude for problem-solving, creativity, and adaptability can contribute to 
                        addressing common objectives and driving meaningful change.</p>
