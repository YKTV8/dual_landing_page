        <h2>Hi I'm Geoffrey, your next Developer!</h2>
        <p>A software developer with a passion for attention to detail and a deep understanding of the insurance industry. Paired with years of experience in software development, I have honed my skills in building software solutions that cater to the specific needs of each clients.
            What sets me apart are two things:
        <ol>
            <li>1. Knowledge of the insurance industry,through years of working with insurance clients. With expertise in this field provides me the ability to develop software solutions that not only meet clients' needs but also ensure compliance within their carrier's guidelines.</li>
            <li>2. I'm local and understand what it takes to operate as a small business owner in Washington.</li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>We prefer to work locally with small business owners to make the expierence smooth, seamless and unique. We understand that there's no clock in or clock out, it's an around the clock commitment that leaves many with no time to spare. <br>
        Whether you dont have an online presence or started the task of setting up a web presence but found that the management system is difficult to navigate through or simple don't have the time you thought you would, allow us to step in to and be the solution!</p>
