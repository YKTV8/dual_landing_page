        <h2>Hi I'm Geoffrey, your next Developer!</h2>
        <p>As a seasoned software developer with a passion for precision, I specialize in crafting tailored software solutions that meet the specific needs of each client. With years of experience serving clients in the insurance industry, I possess a deep understanding of their unique requirements and compliance guidelines.

            What sets me apart is my expertise in the insurance field, acquired through years of working with industry-leading clients. <br><br> This knowledge enables me to develop software solutions that not only meet clients' needs but also ensure strict adherence to carrier guidelines.
            
            Furthermore, as a small business owner myself, I understand what it takes to succeed in Washington. I prefer working locally with small business owners to ensure a seamless and personalized experience. <br><br> I recognize that running a small business requires around-the-clock commitment, which is why I'm always available to provide support and guidance.
            
            Whether you're starting from scratch or struggling with your current online presence, I'm here to help. With my skills and experience, I can make the process simple and stress-free, leaving you with more time to focus on growing your business. Allow me to be your solution!</p>
