									<p>Motivated by my passion for applying technology to solve real-world challenges, I embarked on a career as a bail bonds agent. In this role, I honed my problem-solving skills by finding creative solutions to secure underwriter approvals for client releases on the company's bond per contract. The complex and unpredictable nature of this work only fueled my interest further.

										During my time in the bail bonds industry, I had the opportunity to explore new technologies that enhanced our client service. One such technology was bondstracking, a software solution developed by our IT division. As an agent, I actively gathered user feedback and collaborated with the IT team to improve the software, which was built using HTML, CSS, and early JavaScript.
										<br>
										<br>
										Eager to further my career and expand my problem-solving capabilities, I obtained full-lines insurance licenses, delving deeper into the insurance industry. Here, I encountered more software solutions aimed at improving client service and agent efficiency. However, I often found that these tools fell short of their promised functionality, sparking a realization that my unique experience and problem-solving skills could be harnessed on the tech side of the spectrum.
										<br>
										<br>
										Motivated by this "ah-ha" moment, I decided to dedicate my free time during the pandemic to become a full stack software developer. Frustrated with consistently attributing technical issues to the "server," I took action to acquire the skills necessary to provide meaningful solutions in the tech field. With a solid foundation in both the bail bonds and insurance industries, where I encountered countless issues with carrier websites and software environments, I recognized the importance of developing technology that truly meets end users' needs.
										<br>
										<br>
										Now, as a seasoned software developer with a penchant for precision, I specialize in crafting tailored software solutions that address the specific requirements of each client. My years of experience serving clients in the insurance industry have granted me a deep understanding of their unique needs and compliance guidelines. This expertise allows me to develop software solutions that not only meet clients' requirements but also adhere strictly to carrier guidelines.
										<br>
										<br>
										Moreover, my experience as a small business owner myself has equipped me with insights into the challenges faced by local businesses in Washington. I prioritize working closely with small business owners to provide a seamless and personalized experience. Recognizing the 24/7 commitment required to run a small business, I am always available to offer support and guidance.
										<br>
										<br>
										Whether you're starting from scratch or struggling with your current online presence, I am here to help simplify and streamline the process. With my skills and experience, I can provide a stress-free experience, leaving you with more time to focus on growing your business. Allow me to be your solution, leveraging my expertise and knowledge in the tech field to make a difference.</p>

This involves working closely with project stakeholders to understand their requirements and developing software that meets those needs while adhering to industry best practices and standards.

										In addition to technical expertise, software developers must also possess strong problem-solving skills, as they are often called upon to troubleshoot and resolve issues with software applications. This requires a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle and the ability to work collaboratively with other developers, quality assurance professionals, and project managers.
										
										Another key aspect of a software developer's focus is on staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies. This involves continually learning and refining skills, staying current with new programming languages and frameworks, and experimenting with emerging technologies to develop new and innovative software solutions.
