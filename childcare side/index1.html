            <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am Bethany Matthews, co-founder of Chae & Marie Solutions, LLC. As a mother, wife, and daughter, I am intimately aware of the anxieties that 
            first-time mothers experience, particularly when returning from maternity leave. My husband and I searched tirelessly for child care options that 
            would provide peace of mind, but every option proved either unrealistic or prohibitively expensive.
            <img src="../images/lady5.jpg">
            Ultimately, I decided to leave my career in dentistry behind and devote my time to our future: our children. My goal is to offer mothers and fathers the 
            reassurance that their precious little ones are safe, engaged, and excited to arrive at our care facility each day. By providing a nurturing environment 
            that encourages social interaction and exploration, we aim to teach our children vital social skills in today's socially distant world. Our hope is to restore
            some normalcy to their lives while fostering a love of learning and growth. "If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to support that child's parent." Ann Douglas</p>

        <!-- <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Bethany Matthews, I am a Mother, Wife, Daughter and Co-Founder of Chae & Marie Solutions, LLC. One of the most common anxieties for most first-time Mothers is "Worry-Mom Syndrome". 
            Especially when the time comes to returning from maternity leave. My husband and I looked over every option for child care that would bring comfort. From in-home nanny, 
            daycares and even bringing my child to work with me. All options were either too expensive or unrealistic.
            <img src="../images/lady5.jpg">
            Ultimately I made my decision to leave behind my career in dentistry and commit my time to our future - Our Children.       
            I am determined to provide Mothers & Fathers a piece of mind that their perfect creations are safe, included, 
            excited to arrive to care each day and interact with other children as they explore and learn!
            Our hope is to bring back some normalcy by teaching our children vital social skills in a highly emphasized socially distant world.
