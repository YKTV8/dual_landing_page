        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Bethany Matthews, I am a Mother, Wife, Daughter and Co-Founder of Chae & Marie Solutions, LLC. One of the most common anxieties for most first-time Mothers is "Worry-Mom Syndrome". 
            Especially when the time comes to returning from maternity leave. My husband and I looked over every option for child care that would bring comfort. From in-home nanny, 
            daycares and even bringing my child to work with me. All options were either too expensive or unrealistic.
            <!--div class="section__image"></div-->

            Ultimately I made my decision to leave behind my career in dentistry and commit my time to our future - Our Children.       
            I am determined to provide Mothers & Fathers a piece of mind that their perfect creations are safe, included, 
            excited to arrive to care each day and interact with other children as they explore and learn!
            Our hope is to bring back some normalcy by teaching our children vital social skills in a highly emphasized socially distant world.
