                15+ years in the dental field. Becoming a mother encouraged me into changing careers to be able to become more active at home. Evolving into Chae & Marie Solutions LLC. Baelynn was born right before the Covid-19 pandemic happened, causing a lot of the infant toddler social activities to no longer exist. Creating the in home care center allowed me to introduce social skills in a controlled environment. In addition to creating a safe environment for other family’s to feel comfortable with childcare as close to the care they provide at home!
