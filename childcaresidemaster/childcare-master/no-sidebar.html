										<div class="overlay"><p>Bethany Matthews(Owner)
											With over 15 years of experience in the dental field, I felt a strong desire to balance my professional career
											with my role as a mother. This led me to pursue a new career path and establish Chae & Marie Solutions LLC. 
											When my daughter Baelynn was born shortly before the outbreak of Covid-19, it became clear that many social 
											activities for infants and toddlers would be unavailable for the foreseeable future. As a result, 
											I established an in-home care center where I could provide a safe and nurturing environment for children to 
											develop their social skills in a controlled setting. My goal is to offer families a childcare solution that 
											is as close to the care they would provide in their own homes as possible. As a STARS certified provider, 
											I possess the knowledge and skills to provide a high-quality care program that emphasizes the importance of 
											early childhood development.</p>

											Kianna has a decade of experience in the dental industry, having worked alongside Bethany. Growing up in a large Samoan family where children are abundant, she has a natural affinity for kids who are drawn to her warm and engaging personality. Kianna's passion for American Sign Language (ASL) is evident as she has completed several courses and consistently encourages our young ones to learn and use sign language. Along with contributing to the development of our weekly menus and activities, Kianna's unique skill set and infectious energy make her an invaluable member of our team.</p>

											Prior to the birth of her son Kingston, Miss Chanler had worked as an in-home nanny for a family for five years. However, upon becoming a stay-at-home mom, she began searching for a career that would allow her to include her child. At 10 months old, Kingston joined our care group at Chae & Marie, where Miss Chanler quickly proved to be an excellent addition to our team. Her engaging personality, combined with an abundance of patience, make her a natural fit for working with children. Our little ones adore Miss Chanler, and we feel fortunate to have her as part of our team.</p>

Her patience, reliability, and proactive nature have made her an invaluable asset to our team. Miss Holly's experience has been a significant addition to our organization, and we consider ourselves fortunate to have her with us.</p>

										<div class="overlay5"><p>Iris Bryant(Child Care professional toddlers/infants)-
											Miss Iris has become a beloved figure amongst the children in our care, and the feeling is mutual. We recognize that caring for infants involves a more complicated schedule, and to ensure consistency, we entrust Iris with managing their daily routine. After her relocation from Yakima in 2019, Iris devoted her time to care for her first grandchild, Baelynn, while Bethany returned to work. Prior to moving to Bonney Lake, Iris had been a certified phlebotomist in Yakima. We are grateful for her expertise, her nurturing nature, and the warmth she brings to our care group.</p>
